# Project Shooter

Welcome to the Project Shooter repository! This is a WebGL-based Unity game created during a 48-hour hackathon organized by Playrix. After the competition, the game was further polished.

## About the Game

Project Shooter is a top-down shooter game. Use the WASD or arrow keys to control your character, and the mouse to aim and shoot. The goal is to complete the level, reach the end, and collect the main pile of Rix coins. You'll earn points for each coin you find along the way and for every second remaining on the timer. Points are recorded in the leaderboard, allowing you to compare your results with your friends!
